# Animal-Trading-Cards
#### A Udacity's Front End Development Project

In this project, I had the opportunity to demonstrate my new web development skills by re-creating a webpage from a design prototype.
It is a common workflow for new beginers learning Front-End web development. Our task was to create a functional website of an animal greeting card of choice, I chose 
to use an hyppo for my project because I just thought it would be different and that hyppos are such great seemingly docile but ferous animal. 

In addition, I designed the page:
* using one separate html file, named projectCard.html
*  "    one    "     CSS file, named styles.css
*  "    one picture file, named Hippo2.jpg

In the projectCard.html, I used a link element to link styles.css to it. Plus, I added class attributes to the elements I wanted to style, such as the _div's_, _paragraphs_, and _lists_ elments, using CSS selectors formatted in the style sheet. 
I custom-sized the image with a width of 400 pixels and used a nice round border-radious of 10px. 
I also formatted the text of the hippo insteresting facts in _italics_, labels for each list items in bold and without dots/bullets (â—¾)
